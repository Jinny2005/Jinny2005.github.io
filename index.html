            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Motivated 12th-grade student with a passion for somatology and a strong desire to be a surgeon. Excels in biology and chemistry, with a proven record of high GPA. Throughout my school life, I have consistently achieved high marks. I am eager to graduate from a medical college while devoting time to serve free surgery to the poor, homeless, and girls in the Middle East who have been attacked.</p>

            <h2>Why These Skills Are Useful for a Future Medicine Major</h2>
            <p>According to the Korean education ministry, high school students can take Biology I and Biology II, which cover only basic biology concepts. However, to prove their suitability for medical majors, medical colleges require students to have a basic understanding of AP Biology, which provides in-depth concepts of biological science. The advanced Life Science Experiment course helps students to acquire the following skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic knowledge of AP Biology is fundamental to participating in medical college courses.</li>
                <li>Collaboration is crucial for future surgeons, as few surgeries are successfully performed by a single individual.</li>
                <li>Further study broadens one's understanding of medical majors.</li>
            </ul>
